/*Problem Statement:

Given a square matrix mat, return the sum of the matrix diagonals.

Only include the sum of all the elements on the primary diagonal 
and all the elements on the secondary diagonal that are not part of the primary diagonal.



*/

/*Solution:

if n*n matrix is given 

-->if n is even then there is no common element
   in between primary and secondary diagonals

-->if n is odd then there is one common element(middle element)
   in between primary and secondary diagonals 
   so we subtract once the middle element from the sum


*/

//C++ Code:

public:
    int diagonalSum(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int n=mat.size();
        int sum=0;
        if(n==1)
            return mat[0][0];
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            sum+=mat[i][i]+mat[i][n-i-1];
        }
        
        if(n%2!=0)
