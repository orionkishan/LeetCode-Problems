/*Problem Statement:
Given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length.

The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"

Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.

*/

/*Solution:

We create a char vector of size equal to size of indices vector
and make a for loop to iterate indices and string s both.
Like our indices[0]= 4 and s[0]=c (in example above)
There fore we put c at str[4].

After this we write all the elements of a vector to string out and then
return the string

//C++ Code:
class Solution {
public:
    string restoreString(string s, vector<int>& indices) {
        
        vector<char>str(indices.size());
        for(int i=0;i<indices.size();i++)
        {   
            str[indices[i]]=s[i];
            
        }
        string out(str.begin(), str.end());
    return out;
