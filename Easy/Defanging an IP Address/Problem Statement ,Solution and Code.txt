/*Problem Statement:

Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"

*/

/*Solution:

We need to replace "." with "[.]'
So we make a string variable named out
We keep a for loop to iterate through address elements
and if address element is we add [.] to out else we add address element




*/

//C++ Code:

class Solution {
public:
    string defangIPaddr(string address) {
        string out;
        for(int i=0;i<address.size();i++){
            if(address[i]=='.')
                out+="[.]";
            else
                out+=address[i];
        }
        return out;
    }
};
